# 🎨 Artify – AI Image Filter Generator  
## 📌 Case Study

---

## ⭐ 1. Problem

In the digital content creation space, users often need fast and aesthetic image transformations — but most tools are:

- Paid  
- Slow  
- Hard to use  
- Dependent on advanced editing skills  

Beginners struggle to:

- Apply high-quality filters  
- Preview results instantly  
- Work without complex tools like Photoshop  
- Download the final output easily  

**Users needed a simple, fast, and free tool for AI-powered photo filters.**

---

## ⭐ 2. Solution

I built **Artify**, an AI-powered image filter generator that allows users to:

- 📤 Upload any image (JPG / PNG)  
- 🎨 Apply multiple filters (Cartoon, Sketch, Grayscale, Sepia, Neon, etc.)  
- 👀 Preview results instantly  
- 📥 Download high-quality output  
- 💎 Use a beautiful, clean, modern UI  
- 📱 Works on web + mobile  

Artify processes images in **real-time** using optimized **OpenCV** pipelines.

## ⭐ 3. Outcome

✔ 10+ professional-grade filters  
✔ Real-time preview  
✔ Super-fast processing using vectorized **NumPy + OpenCV**  
✔ Clean UI using **React + Tailwind**  
✔ Fully deployed & live  
✔ Suitable for photographers, students, designers, social media users  

This project demonstrates:

- AI & Image Processing skills  
- UI/UX design  
- React component architecture  
- API handling  
- Performance optimization

## ⭐ 4. Tech Stack

### 🚀 Programming
- Python  
- TypeScript  
- JavaScript  

### 🧠 Core Libraries
- OpenCV (cv2)  
- NumPy  
- Pillow (PIL)  
- Matplotlib  

### 🎨 Frontend
- React / Next.js  
- Tailwind CSS  

### ⚙ Backend (if applicable)
- Streamlit (previous version)  
- Custom API route (`route.ts`)  

### 🛠 Tools

## ⭐ 5. Models / Techniques Used

Artify uses AI-inspired image transformations using:

- Edge Detection  
- Adaptive Thresholding  
- Gaussian Blur  
- Bilateral Smoothing  
- Color Mapping  
- Custom Convolution Kernels  
- Sketch Effect (B/W + Color)  
- Sepia & Vintage Tone Mapping  
- Cartoon Effect (Edge Mask + Smoothing)  

These combine **classic algorithms + ML-inspired visual transformations**.

## ⭐ 6. App Flow (How It Works)

**Upload Image → Apply Filter → Real-Time Preview → Download Output**

🔹 Frontend sends image to backend  
🔹 OpenCV + NumPy process it instantly  
🔹 Output image is returned and previewed  
🔹 User can switch filters without refresh
